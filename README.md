# Horiseon-Optimized-Refactored-Website

## Description

I was hired by an agency to help "Horiseon" with their website run a little more smoothly and to also make their page more accessible for all search engines. I started out by cleaning up the code a bit wihtout changing their webpage design. I made it more simple to comprehend so that even those with certain disabilitites can use the website without any issues. I also debugged one of the links that was not working properly when you clicked on it.
